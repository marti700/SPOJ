The process of “breaking” an integer is defined as summing the squares of its digits. For example, the
result of breaking the integer 125 is (12 + 22 + 52) = 30. An integer N is happy if after “breaking” it
repeatedly the result reaches 1. If the result never reaches 1 no matter how many times the
“breaking” is repeated, then N is not a happy number.
TASK

Write a program that given an integer N, determines whether it is a happy number or not.
CONSTRAINTS

2 ≤ N ≤ 2,147,483,647
Input

    • A single line containing a single integer N.
Output

    • A single line containing a single integer T which is the number of times the process had to be
      done to determine that N is happy, or -1 if N is not happy.
Example

Input:
19

Output:
4


1) 19   : 12 + 92 = 82
2) 82   : 82 + 22 = 68
3) 68   : 62 + 82 = 100
4) 100 : 12 + 02 + 02 = 1

The solution is 4 because we discovered that the integer 19 is happy after we repeated the process 4
times.


Example

Input:
204

Output:
-1





204 –> 20 –> 4 –> 16 –> 37 –> 58 –> 89 –> 145 –> 42 –> 20 –> 4 –> 16 –> 37 –> 58 –> 89 –> 145 ……..



204 is not a happy number because after breaking it several times the results start repeating so we
can deduce that if we continue breaking it, the result will never reach 1.
